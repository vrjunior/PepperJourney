 Circle CircleFitByTaubin (Data& data)
 /*
 Circle fit to a given set of data points (in 2D)
 
 This is an algebraic fit, due to Taubin, based on the journal article
 
 G. Taubin, "Estimation Of Planar Curves, Surfaces And Nonplanar
 Space Curves Defined By Implicit Equations, With
 Applications To Edge And Range Image Segmentation",
 IEEE Trans. PAMI, Vol. 13, pages 1115-1138, (1991)
 
 Input:  data     - the class of data (contains the given points):
 
 data.n   - the number of data points
 data.X[] - the array of X-coordinates
 data.Y[] - the array of Y-coordinates
 
 Output:
 circle - parameters of the fitting circle:
 
 circle.a - the X-coordinate of the center of the fitting circle
 circle.b - the Y-coordinate of the center of the fitting circle
 circle.r - the radius of the fitting circle
 circle.s - the root mean square error (the estimate of sigma)
 circle.j - the total number of iterations
 
 The method is based on the minimization of the function
 
 sum [(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 - R^2]^2
 F = -------------------------------
 sum [(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2]
 
 This method is more balanced than the simple Kasa fit.
 
 It works well whether data points are sampled along an entire circle or
 along a small arc.
 
 It still has a small bias and its statistical accuracy is slightly
 lower than that of the geometric fit (minimizing geometric distances),
 but slightly higher than that of the very similar Pratt fit.
 Besides, the Taubin fit is slightly simpler than the Pratt fit
 
 It provides a very good initial guess for a subsequent geometric fit.
